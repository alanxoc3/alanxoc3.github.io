I earned my Computer Science degree and survived most of college with only a
little [ASUS x205ta](https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/ASUS_EeeBook_X205TA/)
netbook. This computer has been reliable with me and served me well throughout
the past 4 years.

I will now be saying goodbye to this brave little netbook in exchange for a
bigger computer.
