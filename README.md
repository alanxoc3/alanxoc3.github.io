# Alan's Blog
Originally, I made a webpage with Emacs Org Mode, and a Read the Org theme. But
it wasn't a blog and I didn't want to use Emacs anymore, so I switched to
Jekyll and Github Pages. The main benefit is that I can just use markdown for
my blog now.

Check out the blog here: [alanxoc3.github.io](https://alanxoc3.github.io)
