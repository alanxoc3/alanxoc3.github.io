# Alan's Blog
Originally, I made a webpage with Emacs Org Mode, and a Read the Org theme. But
it wasn't a blog. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of Emacs anyway, so something
had to be done. I decided to move to Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Jekyll is pretty
amazing, it allows me to create a blog like a hacker. So I can do everything
from the command line. Also, my blog posts can be in markdown too!

Another interesting thing that I'm using is "git-lfs" or Git Large File
Support. This is an official git community project that allows binary files to
be stored on GitHub, but changes to the file are not stored. It is convenient
to have large files with Github Pages, but also annoying if changes to the
files are stored. Git-lfs fixes this problem.
