# Alan's Blog
Originally, I made a webpage with Emacs Org Mode, and a Read the Org theme. But
it wasn't a blog. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of Emacs anyway, so something
had to be done. I decided to move to Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Jekyll is pretty
amazing, it allows me to create a blog like a hacker. So I can do everything
from the command line. Also, my blog posts can be in markdown too!

## TODO
- Look at the old website, and think of things that should be migrated.
- Make the post title the same format as the post list title.
